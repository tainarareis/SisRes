1) Comments

Comments have to follow the pattern:

	1.a) One line comments have to be made using "//" before the comment;
			// This is the comment pattern
	
	1.b) Comments in blocks have to be made between the '/*' and '*/';
			/**
                    	* This is
                    	* the pattern
                    	* to be followed
                    	*/
	1.c) To comment methods, the comment should precede it;
		/**
		* The methodo calculatePerimeter calculates the perimeter of a tringle using it sides.
		* @return the triangle's perimeter
		*/
		float calculatePerimeter()
		{
		float result = side1+side2+side3;
		return result;
		}


	1.d) To comment one line of code, the comment must be on the same line.
 		boolean equality;
		equality = (side1 == side2); // is the side one equal to the side 2?
 
                      
 
 
2) Names: Classes, attributes and methods

	The names of classes, attributes and methods will follow the convention addopted in Java, witch consists in:
	- If the name of a class, attribute or method is composed by various words, the CamelCase pattern have to be followed, what consists in keep the initial letters of wich word in Caps.
       
        	Examples:
                    	SportsCar extends Car (for classes)
                    	private int PersonAge (for attributes)
                    	public setPersonName( String name ) (for methods)
                    	
	- Classes names initiates with upper case.
        - Attributes names initiates witih lower case.
        - Methods names initiates with lower case.
        - Constants names have to be writed only in lower case.        	

	OBS: Only one variable declaration per line.
 
3) Identation
		
		The code idention will follow the pattern normally used by Java:

		- Keys wich initiate the body of a class, method or control structure have to be on the same line of the parameters, separated by a unique blank space.
    
 
        	Examples:
                    	int functionName( parameter1, parameter2, parameter3 ) {
	
		- The identation have to be made by four spaces or a equivalent tab.
 
 
4) Classes
		Classes have to follow the model:
        	
		- After the name of the class have to be a blank space followed by the character '{'.
		- The next line after the class signature have to be a blank line.            	
 
        	Example:
                    	public class StyleSheet {

                    		/**
                    		* Have to be a blank line between
                    		* the class signature and the
                    		* first line of code of the class
                    		*/
                    	}      	
 

5) Control Structure: IF
		- Have to be a blank space immediataly after the if.
		- Have to be a blank space between the parentesis and the if condition. 
        	- The operators '==', '<=', '>=', '<', '>', '!=', '&&', '||' gone to have a blank space immediatally to the left and the right.
		- After the parentesis what closes the 'if' condition, have to be a blank space followed by a key what opens the body of the condition.
		- The body of the 'if' always have to be inside keys, even when composed by only one statement. 
		- 'Else if' or 'else' have to be initiated one line beyond the key what closes the if body, following the same if padronization.
		- After all 'if' or 'else if' structure, an 'else' estruture is always needed.
 
        	Examples:
                    	if ( this.idadePessoa < 18 ) {
                    	    System.out.println( "No authorizated to drive!" );
 			} else {
			    // . . .
			}

                    	if ( diaSemana == 1 ) {
                    		System.out.println( "Sunday" );
                    	} else if ( diaSemana == 2 ) {
                    		System.out.println( "Monday" );
 			}
                    	
                     	 
6) Control structure: While
               -While follows the same if pattern:

		Example:

                    	while ( count < numElements ) {
                    		sumElements = sumElements + 1;
                    	}
 
 
7) Control structure: For 
                -For follows the same if pattern;
        	- The operators '=', '==', '!=', '<=', '>=', '&&', '||', as ';' have to be a blank space to the left and to the right;
		- Commas will be positionated imeddiatally after the word witch precedes it.
 
        	Examples:
                    	for ( int i = 0; i < numElements; i++ ) {
                    		//OBS: might have a blank space after the ';' character.
                    	}
 
 
8) Control structure: Switch
        	- Defaults and cases have to be indented;
		- Statements of swich case or default have to be in the next line and indented.
 
        	Examples:
                    	switch ( dayWeek ) {
                    		case 1:
                    	    	System.out.println( "Sunday" );
                    	    	break;
                    		case 2:
                    	    	System.out.println( "Monday" );
                    	    	break;
 
                    		// ...
 
                    		default:
                    	    	System.out.printn( "" );
                    	    	break;
                    	}
 
 
9) Treatment of Exceptions
        	- May be in the following pattern:
 
        	Example:
                    	try {
                    		// block to be executed
                    	}
                    	catch( exception ) {
                    		// chatch's instructions block
                    	}
                    	finally {
                    		// finally instructions block
                    	}
